Each of these improvements will be implemented in small, atomic commits with clear descriptions. The plan is to make over 200 meaningful commits while implementing these features. Each commit will:

1. Focus on a single improvement
2. Include comprehensive tests
3. Update relevant documentation
4. Follow clean code principles
5. Pass all linting and type checks

Implementation Strategy:
1. Start with core security features
2. Implement UI improvements incrementally
3. Add tests alongside new features
4. Optimize performance iteratively
5. Document everything thoroughly

This structured approach will ensure high-quality code while maintaining a clear history of improvements.
